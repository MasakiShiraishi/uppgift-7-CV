       <section id="aboutMe">
        <span>My name is Masaki Shiraishi and come from Japan.</span><br>
        <span>I love sushi and One Piece which is a famous manga all over the world.</span>
        <span>I grew up in the countryside in Fukuoka, Kyushu which is located in southern Japan.</span><br>
       <span>I studied agriculture during junior college, but I joined the JMSDF(Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force) in 2007.</span><br>
       <span>I worked as an air traffic countroller in the JMSDF because the test results showed that I had a talent for it.</span><br>
       <span>After 2007, l lived in many places in Japan. I was living in Chiba before I moved to Sweden.</span><br>
       <span>I think I had a good experience during my previous jobs, but I didn't want to work there any more, because it was too stressful.</span><br>
       <br><br>
       <span>I have been living in Sweden since 2013 and now I live in Järfälla with my Swedish wife, two daughters and a cat.</span><br>
       <span>I work in the warehouse of a Japanese company called JFC Norden.</span><br>
       <span>We sell many different kinds of Japanese food to many restaurants and supermarkets.</span><br>
       <br><span>But I would like to change my career in the future and try something else.</span><br>
       <span>That's why I decided to study system development at Lernia. </span><br>
       <span>Because I worked in JMSDF, I think I have more patience and stamina than other people.</span><br>
       <span>I have been running regularly, and I think that I'm good at not giving up and continuing to do a specific task until I finish it.</I>.</span><br>
       <span>For this reason, I believe that programming work is suitable for me.</span><br>
